What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When init takes place git directory that stores metadata is created and its invisible.Initialisation is needed because of tracking files and being able to commit.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?


Well,its different because its part of git repo,then it doesnt necessarily have all files in working directory.It offers time to think what is perfect time to make commit.
