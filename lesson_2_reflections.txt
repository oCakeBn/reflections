How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?


Well,its different because its part of git repo,then it doesnt necessarily have all files in working directory.It offers time to think what is perfect time to make commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
They help in a way that i know where i left off the main branch,and what commits will be lost if i dont add them to branch
