When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Maybe when i want to share my work with somebody,or want to collaborate.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It could create mess with stuff I'm currently working on.
