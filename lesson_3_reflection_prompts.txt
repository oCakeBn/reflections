When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Maybe when i want to share my work with somebody,or want to collaborate.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It could create mess with stuff I'm currently working on.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is made between servers on github,clones are made on local machine either from github or from another git repo on local disk,branches are made inside git repo.It depends on actual thing I'm working on.



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

We dont need to resolve merge conflicts from remote repo and local repo.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

It would be harder to organise work,when and what will someone change and who will have rights to do that.
