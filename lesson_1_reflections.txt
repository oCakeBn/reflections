How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Well,it was of a tremendous help,because reading so much code would be very hard 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
  
 Well i assume it could save a lots of time,searching for bugs,etc.

 What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

 Good thing i that we can organize commits as logical units,bad thing is judgment on appropriate time to commit

 Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

 I think its about space,I mean where you save files,Google Docs is based on Cloud,and Git can be used offline,so I think thats the main reason

 How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?


 Git log command prints all commits or history of each commit that has been made,and git diff can based upon serial number of ids print differences in commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

It could but i dont see git as testing tool for my code


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Version control :)
